## Overview

This GitHub Action makes it easy to upload all files from a directory to an AWS
S3 bucket and create a GitHub Deployment at the same time.

It was created with the intention of solving a particular issue, so if there's
any functionality that's currently missing, and you'd like to see added in the
future, feel free to reach out! Any other feedback or suggestions are
welcome as well ‚úåÔ∏è
